Description: Revamping of Alaska DEC Air Monitoring regulatory data webpages. Previously, data and graphs for the communities of Alaska were spread across multiple pages on the website. This shiny app will allow users to access data in a central location. It will provide data of EPAs criteria pollutants collected at Alaska's regulatory sites.
